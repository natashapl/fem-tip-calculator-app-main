## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this project, I decided to challenge myself to create the javaScript for this app without looking at anyone else's solution. After years of working with javaScript, I still haven't quite mastered it yet, so projects like these area great practice. I did use online resources such as W3 Schools and MDN Web Docs and the like, as needed.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - A great resource for all things related to CSS, HTML and Javascript.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Another great resource for all things related to CSS, HTML and Javascript
- [20+ Amazing Pure CSS Accordions [Examples 2022]](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/css-accordion/) - More examples of pure CSS accordions for inspiration.
- [Name that Color](https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/) - This is still my favorite utility tool for generating unique color names from hex codes.
